# Analog-Filters-Design
This repository is related to a university course named "Design and Synthesis of Analog Filters" and i've tried to Implement methods and algorithms of this course in jupyter notebook environment.
For now i've just used [scipy.signal](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) functions to indicate features of Lowpass Filters.
## Filter Approximations
- Butterworth filter
- Chebyshev typeI & typeII
- Elliptic filter
- Bessel filter
